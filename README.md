# React-Clicky-Game

# Overview
This is a simple but addictive (and serverless) memory game built using React. It relies on CSS animations and the app's state to shuffle around the images available for clicking.

# Technologies Used:
This project is create React App, and so requires npm/yarn.
I am also using the CDN version of react-materialize.
